 * Class School - have the main methods to work with the students and their numbers. Class School implements an interface class - SchoolStat.
 * Method addStudent - add new students and their data from "somewhere" to the list.
 * Method getAverageAbsence() - find and return an average number of absences.
 * Method getTheBestStudent() - find and return a student with the best grades and middle absences.
 * Method getCount() - returns a number of added students to the list.
 * Method getAverageGrade() - find and return an average grade from the list of students.
 * Method getAverageGradeFromMath() - find and return an average grade from the math.
 * Method getTheWorstStudent() - find and return a student with the worst grades and absences.
 * Method getLowestAbsence() - find and return the minimal (lowest) number of the absence from the list of students.
 * Method getListSortedByLastNameAsc() - get and return the values inside a list (students and their numbers) sorted in an alphabet order by
 * using Collections - framework that provides an architecture to store and manipulate with the group of objects.
 * And by using a Comparator - a functional cookie which can provide ordering on some collection of objects.
 * Method getListSortedByAbsenceDesc() - get and return the values inside a list (students and their numbers) sorted in by a highest absence number.
 * Using the for it Collections and Comparator too.
